# ramona

_I'd forever talk to you  
But soon my words  
Would turn into a meaningless ring_  

-- Bob Dylan, _To Ramona_

## Quickstart

*  see the file [demo_ramona.ipynb](demo_markov.ipynb)
    * presents the theory and implementation details.
* see the file [ramona/model.py](ramona/model.py) for the NLP full implementation
    * uses NLTK, which needs *punkt* installed
* run the interactive command interface [ramona.py](ramona.py)
    * clone this repo, create a venv, install the requirements then
    * `bash_prompt>  python3 ramona.py`
    * type `help` to get a list of commands
    * see the demo screencast here: [TODO]
